title: Current Routine
---

I am about 2 months into the Bloc program and at this point I would like to talk about the daily routine I have developed for myself and why it has been working for me.  First thing in the morning, after walking my dogs and eating breakfast, I open up codewars.  I find a challenge in my skill level and take out pencil and paper.   Yes, pencil and paper.  Not repl, not codepen.   I write out my logic for how I want to attack this problem until I have a solid enough formation of attack.  At this point I open up repl and begin implementing my code.  If I can’t solve the problem in less than 45 minutes I move on to my program’s daily checkpoints.  I have found that working on a codewars challenge first thing in the morning is incredibly powerful for jump-starting my brain.  Even if I don’t end up solving the problem, I still get my creative mind active and ready to solve the other problems of the day.   To be honest though, if I solve the codewars challenge I am usually twice as productive from the confidence boost that follows.    

During the middle of the day, after going for another walk with the dogs and eating lunch, its time to get back to work. My strategy for regaining momentum after the mid day lunch break is to watch a quick YouTube video that is somewhat related to programming. I find that watching a nice, light and short tutorial or discussion about something programming related is the best way to get myself motivated to power through new technical jargon that sometimes makes me want to put my face through my monitor.  However, if I am actually trying to solve a problem writing code during a programming checkpoint, than I rarely lack any motivation after the mid day break and just get straight back to problem solving.  

I also try to sprinkle a few 5-10 minute breaks throughout the day to help keep me focused and sharp into the evening time. At around 6pm, my end of the day strategy is to grab a nice cold beverage and bask in the feeling of knowing I had a productive day.  I usually tell myself at this point in the evening that its time to unwind and recharge my energy. However, if I’m being honest, I find myself doing additional work here and there into the night to feed my hunger and newfound addiction of learning to code.  With this basic structured work day, I have been able to limit and manage any stress that comes my way.
