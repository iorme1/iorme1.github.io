short-description: An app for 2nd grade teachers to help organize their standards-related data
---

As my programming skills improve, I am asking my friends and family for app ideas that would make their lives easier in some way.  The best app idea I heard was for my girlfriend who is a 2nd grade teacher.  The idea behind the app was to help her organize her student's data related to Common Core standards that her 2nd grade students need to meet each year.  The app comes pre-loaded with all 99 of the 2nd grade standards with associated text areas for notes/related assignments/checkboxes for completion.  Any teacher using the app will have the ability to add each of their students to their profile.  Once a student has been added, they can click to view their record which leads to a page of all the 2nd grade subjects. Each subject can be filtered by clicking the appropriate subject button. The student's record page contains all the information related to their progress towards completing the 2nd grade Common Core standards.
