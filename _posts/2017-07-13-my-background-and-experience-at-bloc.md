  title: My Background and Experience at Bloc
---
 My path to the Bloc programâ€™s Software Development Track was a bit unconventional.  After college, I was playing online poker professionally for three years before I made a decision to switch career paths.  The future of online poker was not looking good due to increasingly stricter government regulations so I decided to use the money I saved to further my education. Through my research, I realized that many of the skills that made me successful in poker mirrored some of the skills of being a successful programmer. I achieved an incredible amount of discipline working for myself as well as the ability to consistently research, study, and adapt my current strategies based on changes in the way poker was being played by the population.  Once I decided to get into the programming field, I chose to enroll in Bloc. I came into this program with an open mind and the belief that I would enjoy coding and programming due to my love of computers, new challenges, and solving problems. I am still in the beginning learning stages of programming and coding and I have thoroughly enjoyed the learning process thus far.

I started out in this program learning the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  I found HTML and CSS to be fairly straightforward but it was a humbling experience when I reached the more advanced parts of JavaScript.  I struggled constantly with learning JavaScript and I had moments of doubt in my ability to become successful in this field.  However, through some perseverance and determination I began to get a better handle on the language and started to gain the ability to solve some low level codewars challenges.  Being able to solve a few codewars challenges using JavaScript felt great and gave me a boost of confidence I truly needed to gain some momentum in the learning process.  Although learning JavaScript has been a struggle, It has been easy for me to put in the necessary hours because I love what I am doing.

 My first project in the Bloc program was to create a music playing web application.  At this point in the program I was nowhere near ready to build a site like this on my own, but luckily the program provided most of the code.  My understanding of the project code was tested throughout multiple checkpoints by making me fill in my own code implementations to get certain parts of the site functioning properly.  Implementing my own code into this project gave me excellent practice with solving problems on my own.  It truly forced me to understand what was going on with the flow of the code and be able to trace through a large web of interconnected functions and variables in order to inject some of my own logic. This project opened my eyes and allowed me to see the development process for the first time from start to finish.   Using my own computer, text editor, and files, I was able to be part of the development process and get some hands on experience.
